In CSS Flexbox, you have justify-content (note the correct spelling), but there is no justify-items property for flex containers.
Here's what you actually have in Flexbox:
Main axis alignment:

justify-content - aligns flex items along the main axis (horizontally by default)

Cross axis alignment:

align-items - aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertically by default)
align-content - aligns flex lines when there are multiple lines

You might be thinking of CSS Grid, which does have justify-items for aligning grid items along the inline (row) axis. But in Flexbox, you only use justify-content for main axis alignment and align-items/align-content for cross axis alignment.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
